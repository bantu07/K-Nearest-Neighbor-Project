# K-Nearest-Neighbor Project
Here in this repository you will find the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms which i worked on. 
KNN can be applied for both regression and classification. But it is efficient for classification  
It uses distance measures to classify the data, Types of Distance Measures used are : 
1. Euclidean distance formula.
2. Mahalnobis distance formula.
3. Manhathan distance formula.

Also to find the distance of classification variable we have Hamming distance
